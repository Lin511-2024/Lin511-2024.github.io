    "text": "A Pushdown Automaton\nRobin was really upset and embarrassed at losing two whole tokens to the rip-off (finite state) machine in front of their friends. They vowed to invent a better turnstile so no one would ever have to face that kind of embarrassment again.\n\nIncorporating a memory\nThe problem with the finite-state turnstile is that it has no “memory” of how many coins it’s been fed. Robin’s new prototype works like so:\n\nEvery time someone inserts a coin into Robin’s turnstile, it lands in a little collection tray. If someone inserts multiple coins, they form a stack of coins.\nIf there is even one coin in the stack, the turnstile is unlocked.\nAny time someone pushes through the turnstile, the collection tray bounces one coin off of the stack.\n\nEven this simple system gets a little unwieldy to represent in the same kind of state diagram. So, here’s the last one of these we’ll see for a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\nstateDiagram\n  direction LR\n  state \"Locked\" as l\n  state \"Unlocked\" as u\n  state coin_fork1 &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n  state coin_fork2 &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n  state pop1 &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n  state pop2 &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n  state choice_state &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;\n  state \"Stack\" as s\n  \n  [*] --&gt; l\n  l --&gt; l : push\n  l --&gt; coin_fork1: coin\n  coin_fork1 --&gt; u\n  coin_fork1 --&gt; s: +1\n  u --&gt; coin_fork2: coin\n  coin_fork2 --&gt; u\n  coin_fork2 --&gt; s: +1\n  \n  u --&gt; choice_state: push\n  choice_state --&gt; pop1: if Stack &gt; 1\n  pop1 --&gt; s: -1\n  pop1 --&gt; u\n  \n  choice_state --&gt; pop2: if Stack == 1\n  pop2 --&gt; s: -1\n  pop2 --&gt; l\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Pushdown Turnstile\nWith Robin’s new Pushdown Turnstile installed at metro stations everywhere, they bring their two friends back to the scene of the crime, and retry their three-coins, three-people strategy.

Another way of notating that sequence of events is \\(^n\\)\\(^n\\). In the more formal-language-theory world, these kinds of patterns are usually labeled \\(a^nb^n\\).\nAnother way to think about these \\(a^nb^n\\) systems is in terms of bracket matching. If we replace each  symbol with [ and each  symbol with ], then we get a pattern that looks like this:\n[\n[\n[\n]\n]\n]\nThe requirement for the language is that every opening bracket [ needs to get matched with a closing bracket ].",

    "text": "What does this have to do with “Regular Expressions?”\n“Regular Expressions” are a concise, computery way to define finite state automata that take text as input strings and return matches. That is, regular expressions can identify strings that belong to “regular” languages.\nWe’ll talk about details later, but if I wasn’t sure of someone was using British spelling or American spelling, I could write a RegEx to match either color or colour.\n\n\ncolou?r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstateDiagram\n  direction LR\n  [*] --&gt; 1\n  1 --&gt; 2: c\n  2 --&gt; 3: o\n  3 --&gt; 4: l\n  4 --&gt; 5: o\n  5 --&gt; 6: u\n  5 --&gt; [*]: r\n  6 --&gt; [*]: r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of RegEx\nBecause Regular Expressions define a finite state automaton, and FSAs can only successfully recognize regular languages, that means you can’t use Regular Expressions (reliably) to recognize any more complex language.\nFor example, HTML pages use “tags” to define where text elements begin and end. In this code snippet, the opening &lt;p&gt; tag says a paragraph is beginning, and the closing &lt;/p&gt; says the paragraph is ending. The opening &lt;strong&gt; tag says the text is turning bold, and the closing &lt;/strong&gt; tag says the text is turning regular again.\n\nhtml\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n  This is a paragraph with \n  &lt;strong&gt;\n    bold text\n  &lt;/strong&gt;\n  .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\nFor an html page to be valid, every opening tag, &lt;tag&gt; needs to have a matching closing tag &lt;/tag&gt;.\nYou can’t have a closing tag &lt;/tag&gt; without a preceding opening &lt;tag&gt;.\nYou you can embed another opening and closing tag set within another opening and closing tag set.\nThis kind of long distance “bracket matching”, where you can have intervening brackets, requires at least a push-down automaton to recognize.\nThat means html is a context-sensitive language.\nYou cannot use RegEx to successfully validate html.",

The important to thing to keep in mind is that while you are using the command line interface you are inside of a folder. There are two commands I recommend using over and over again to figure out where you are, and where you can go.\n\n“The Prompt”\nWe call the the space waiting for us to type in something the “prompt”. It usually has a symbol before it. Depending on your system, it might be any of the following: $, %, or &gt;. If you type something in here, your computer will interpret it as a command, and try to run it. \n\n\npwd\nIf you type in pwd into the terminal and hit enter, it will print out the absolute path to where you currently are. When you first launch a terminal, it usually starts you off in your home directory, which is usually going to be named after your username.\n\nbash\n\npwd\n/Users/Display\nUse pwd early, and use it often. It stands for present working directory. \n\n\nls\nIf you type in ls into the terminal and hit enter, it will print out a list of all of the directories and files inside the folder you are currently in. Here’s how it prints out on my own computer when I first launch Terminal:\n\nbash\n\nls\nDesktop      Library    Pictures\nDocuments    Movies     Public\nDownloads    Music      Sites  \nEach of the items listed here is another directory inside of my current directory. I can look inside and get a list of all the files inside of these directories by typing in ls and the name of the directory I want to see inside of. For example, if I wanted to get a list of all of the files on my desktop, this is what I would type:\n\nbash\n\nls Desktop\nSampletext.txt\nI only have one file on my desktop right now, and it’s a document called Sampletext.txt. \n\n\nKnow your surroundings\nReally skilled and accomplished programmers use the commands pwd and ls constantly, and so should you! It’s the only way to keep track of your surroundings on the command line. \nIf you ever are looking at a terminal, and don’t know what to do next, just type in pwd and ls. \nEvery time you do a new thing in the terminal, type in type in pwd and ls afterwards.\nJust type in pwd and ls all the time. :::",

To do this, we use the cd command, which stands for change directory.\n\ncd : Moving down 1 level\nTo change the folder you’re in, you just need to type in cd and then the name of the folder. For example to move from my home directory into my Documents folder, it would look like this:\n\nbash\n\nls\nDesktop     Library   Pictures\nDocuments   Movies    Public\nDownloads   Music     Sites\n\nbash\n\ncd Documents\nls\nFranklinInstituteSamples.pptx   Zoom\nFranklinInstituteSounds         html_practice\n\nbash\n\npwd\n/Users/Display/Documents\n\nFirst, I double checked which directories were in the folder I was currently in with ls.\nSecond, I moved into the Documents directory with cd Documents.\nThird, I checked what files and directories were in my new location with ls.\nFourth, I double checked my current location with pwd, which gave my the absolute path to where I was.\n\n\n\ncd : Moving up 1 level\nIf after moving into my documents folder, I wanted to move back to my home directory, that would involve moving up one level, because my Documents folder is inside of my home directory. We can do this using cd again, but instead of the name of a directory, we follow it with ... The two dots, .., is a short hand for “one level up from where I am.” Here’s how that works out on my system.\n\nbash\n\npwd\n/Users/Display/Documents\n\nbash\n\ncd ..\npwd\n/Users/Display\n\nFirst, I double checked where I was with pwd.\nSecond, I moved up one level with cd ..\nThird, I double checked where I would up with pwd again, confirming that I was now in my home directory again.\n\n\n\ncd : Moving down multiple levels\nYou don’t have to move down just one level at a time. For example, right now we’re in my home directory, but inside of my documents there’s a directory called html_practice. That’s two levels down. To get into html_practice, I just need to enter cd followed by the relative path to it. Remember, the relative path is the sequence of directory names that lie between where we are and where we want to go. Here’s how that looks on my system.\n\nbash\n\npwd\n/Users/Display\n\nbash\n\ncd Documents/html_practice\npwd\n/Users/Display/Documents/html_practice\n\nbash\n\nls\nsite.html  style.css\n\nFirst, I double checked my location with pwd\nSecond, I moved down two levels through Documents into html_practice with cd.\nThird, I double checked where I had moved to with pwd.\nLastly, I checked what files were in my new directory with ls.\n\n\n\nMoving up and over\nNow, we’re inside html_practice which is inside Documents. But what if we wanted to move into another directory that is also inside of Documents. For example, the directory Zoom is also inside of Documents, which is where Zoom saves all of the chat logs from our class meetings.\n\n\n\nWhere we want to move\n\n\nWe could do this in a two step process, using cd .. to move up one level, then cd Zoom to move into the zoom directory. But we can also combine the two into one step.\n\nbash\n\npwd\n/Users/Display/Documents/html_practice\n\nbash\n\ncd ../Zoom\npwd\n/Users/Display/Documents/Zoom\n\nFirst, I double checked where I was with pwd.\nThen, I moved up into Documents and down into Zoom in one go with cd ../Zoom\nFinally, I double checked where I wound up with pwd.",

    "text": "Very useful tips!\nThere are a few tips, tricks, and shortcuts that can make using the command line a little bit easier.\n\nTab autocomplete\nWhen using a command line interface, “tab autocomplete” is a crucial tool to help you get around. For example, if you are in your home directory and you want to move into your documents directory, all you really need to type is cd Doc and the terminal should autocomplete the rest of the file name! \nIf you have multiple directories that start with Doc, it will list all of them, and then you’ll only need to type in a few more characters before it will be able to autocomplete. \nTab autocomplete works for ls as well, which can let you explore through directories without needing to move around.\n\n\nGet back home!\nTechnically, your home directory is a directory with a long absolute path. But because it’s a directory you’ll probably want to keep getting back to often, there’s a shortcut built in. If you run cd ~, it will zip you back to your home directory from wherever you are.\n\n\nAbsolute paths\nIf, for some reason, you don’t know what the relative path is to a directory you want to get to from where you are (or maybe it’s very complicated), you can always run cd followed by the absolute path to where you want to go.",

It’s about any system or language which has a strict set of acceptable symbols, and how they can be combined.\n\nGitHub Codespaces\n\nGitHub Codespaces are a ‘development environment’, running on a Virtual Machine. They’re like mini computers you can access through your web browser that get created just for the repository you launch one in. The actual memory and computation are being run on GitHub’s physical computers.\n\nIndex (noun)\n\nA value (usually an integer) that denotes the location of a valuable in an indexable object.\n\nIndex (verb)\n\nTo use a numeric index on an object to return the value at that index.\n\nLocal (adj)\n\nDescribes anything that exists or happens on the actual device you’re interacting with. For example, if you have a Microsoft Word document on your computer that ends in .docx, it is probably ‘local’ (even if theres a ‘remote’ copy somewhere). These days, it’s not always obvious if things happen locally or remotely. If you have a phone that does facial recognition on pictures you take, if the facial recognition program runs on your phone, it’s ‘local’. But if the picture needs to get uploaded to Apple or Google first, then the facial recognition is ‘remote’.\n\nRemote (adj)\n\nDescribes anything that exists or happens on a different device than the one you’re interacting with. For example, if you edit a Google Doc, the actual document is stored on a Google computer, not on the device you’re editing.\n\nSlice (verb)\n\nTo pull out a range of values from an object, defined by a starting and stopping position.\n\nTab Autocomplete\n\nMany programming applications have “Tab Autocomplete” suggestions that allow you to type in just a few letters of the command, function, or variable you want to use, and then hit TabTab.\n\nTerminal\n\nA text based interface to your computer. Instead of clicking on visual icons to, say, open a folder and look at its contents, you type in text based commands like cd and ls.\n\nVirtual Machine/VM\n\nVirtual Machines are simulations of computers. It’s like having an encapsulated computer, running its own operating system and programs, that borrows memory and computing resources from computers it’s running on.\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC-BY-SA 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{fruehwald,\n  author = {Fruehwald, Josef},\n  title = {Glossary},\n  url = {https://lin511-2024.github.io/notes/concepts/00_glossary.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nFruehwald, Josef. n.d. “Glossary.” https://lin511-2024.github.io/notes/concepts/00_glossary.html.",

Instead, I’ll encourage you to try different statements, like\n\n“I’m not familiar with these concepts yet.”\n“Up to now, I’ve found these methods opaque.”\n\nWe can acknowledge your current struggle or confusion with computation or technology, while also acknowledging that their use is a skill, not a talent, and that skill can be built upon and improved with experience and practice.",

We will all be accessing the CLI through Visual Studio Code. For Windows users, this will also involve installing Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n\n\nPython Scripts & Jupyter Notebooks\nPython is the programming language that we’ll be using to do most of our work and analysis in this course. We’ll also be using extensions to the Python programming language in the form of freely available Python libraries, such as nltk and numpy.\nWe’ll be writing both python scripts as well as using Jupyter notebooks to interact with python.\n\n\nVisual Studio Code\nThe fact we will be “writing” python scripts implies we will be writing them in something. The program we will be using for composing our programs will be Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a general purpose Integrated Development Environment (IDE).\nAs “formal languages”, programming languages are very sensitive to any kind of typo or formatting error. The purpose IDEs is to provide you support to avoid these typos & errors in the first place, and to warn you when they exist.\n\n\nGit/Github\nGit is a “Version Control System” that lets you keep track of changes on software projects. Github is a service that allows online hosting of Git projects. You will need to create a free a Github account for the course.\nThere will be a number of course assignments that you will submit via commits to GitHub.\n\n\nCanvas\nCanvas will be used to make course announcements, and to distribute assignment links.",

Only grades as they are appear on Canvas are your official grade.\n\n\nFinal Project\nA final capstone project for the course. This could be a report, an extension of an earlier exercise, or some other agreed upon format.\n\n\nEngagement\nInspired by Kirby Conrod’s approach to Participation Grades\n\nThis portion of the grade is a way for me to give you credit for informal/unstructured collaborative work that you do. Participation and collaboration are strong predictors of success and learning retention, so please make an effort to find a way that works well for you to participate and engage with your colleagues.\n\nA well known process for solving programming problems is “Rubber Duck Debugging.” It works by describing how each step of a program is supposed to work to another person or, as the name suggests, a rubber duck. Often the solution to the problem or the typo causing the bug jumps out at you during the process. Having a study buddy or study group could be really helpful if only for this purpose.",

    "text": "13 Academic Conduct\nUK Senate rules on academic offences\nAppropriating someone else’s work and portraying it as your own is cheating. Collaborating with someone and portraying that work as solely your own is cheating. Obtaining answers to homework assignments or exams from previous semesters is cheating. Using an internet search engine to look up a question and reporting that answer as your own is cheating. Falsifying data or experimental results is cheating. If you are unsure about whether a specific action is cheating, you may check with me.\nThe minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or if the student has other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to suspension from the University may be imposed.\nWhen students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording or anything else from another source without appropriate acknowledgement of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism. Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else’s work, whether it be a published article, chapter of a book, a paper from a friend or some file, or something similar to this. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as their own, whoever that other person may be.\nStudents may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, but when the actual work is done, it must be done by the student, and the student alone. When a student’s assignment involves research in outside sources of information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where and how they employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these Rules shall apply to those ideas which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain (University Senate Rules Section 6.3.1).",

    "section": "14 University Academic Policy Statements",
    "text": "14 University Academic Policy Statements\nLink to University Senate Academic Policy Statements\n\nExcused Absences and Acceptable Excuses\n\nExcused Absences: Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences: (a) significant illness, (b) death of a family member, (c) trips for members of student organizations sponsored by an educational unit, trips for University classes, and trips for participation in intercollegiate athletic events, (d) major religious holidays, (e) interviews for graduate/professional school or full-time employment post-graduation, and (f) other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for nonattendance” by the instructor of record. Students should notify the professor of absences prior to class when possible.\nIf a course syllabus requires specific interactions (e.g., with the instructor or other students), in situations where a student’s total EXCUSED absences exceed 1/5 (or 20%) of the required interactions for the course, the student shall have the right to request and receive a “W,” or the Instructor of Record may award an “I” for the course if the student declines a “W.” (Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.3.1)\n\n\n\nReligious Observances\n\nReligious Observances: Students anticipating an absence for a major religious holiday are responsible for notifying the instructor in writing of anticipated absences due to their observance of such holidays. Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1(4) requires faculty to include any notification requirements within the syllabus. If no requirement is specified, two weeks prior to the absence is reasonable and should not be given any later. Information regarding major religious holidays may be obtained through the Ombud’s websiteor calling 859-257-3737.\n\n\n\nVerification of Absences\n\nVerification of Absences:Students may be asked to verify their absences in order for them to be considered excused. Senate Rule 5.2.5.2.1 states that faculty have the right to request appropriate verification when students claim an excused absence due to: significant illness; death in the household, trips for classes, trips sponsored by an educational unit and trips for participation related to intercollegiate athletic events; and interviews for full-time job opportunities after graduation and interviews for graduate and professional school. (Appropriate notification of absences due to University-related trips is required prior to the absence when feasible and in no case more than one week after the absence.)\n\n\n\nMake-Up Work\n\nMake-Up Work: Students missing any graded work due to an excused absence are responsible: for informing the Instructor of Record about their excused absence within one week following the period of the excused absence (except where prior notification is required); and for making up the missed work. The instructor must give the student an opportunity to make up the work and/or the exams missed due to the excused absence, and shall do so, if feasible, during the semester in which the absence occurred. The instructor shall provide the student with an opportunity to make up the graded work and may not simply calculate the student’s grade on the basis of the other course requirements, unless the student agrees in writing. According to SR 5.2.5.2.2, if a student adds a class after the first day of classes and misses graded work, the instructor must provide the student with an opportunity to make up any graded work.\n\n\n\nExcused Absences for Military Duties\n\nExcused Absences for Military Duties: If a student is required to be absent for one-fifth or less of the required course interactions (e.g., class meetings) due to military duties, the following procedure (per SR 5.2.5.2.3.2) shall apply:\n\nOnce a student is aware of a call to duty, the student shall provide a copy of the military orders to the Director of the Veterans Resource Center. The student shall also provide the Director with a list of his/her courses and instructors.\nThe Director will verify the orders with the appropriate military authority, and on behalf of the military student, notify each Instructor of Record via Department Letterhead as to the known extent of the absence.\nThe Instructor of Record shall not penalize the student’s absence in any way and shall provide accommodations and timeframes so that the student can make up missed assignments, quizzes, and tests in a mutually agreed upon manner.\n\n\n\n\nUnexcused Absences\n\nUnexcused Absences: If an attendance/interaction policy is not stated in the course syllabus or the policy does not include a penalty to the student, the instructor cannot penalize a student for any unexcused absences. (SR 5.2.5.2.3.3)\n\n\n\nPrep Week and Reading Days\n\nPrep Week and Reading Days: Per Senate Rules 5.2.5.6, the last week of instruction of a regular semester is termed “Prep Week.” This phrase also refers to the last three days of instruction of the summer session and winter intersession. The Prep Week rule applies to ALL courses taught in the fall semester, spring semester, and summer session, including those taught by distance learning or in a format that has been compressed into less than one semester or session. This rule does not apply to courses in professional programs in colleges that have University Senate approval to have their own calendar.\nMake-up exams and quizzes are allowed during Prep Week. In cases of “Take Home” final examinations, students shall not be required to return the completed examination before the regularly scheduled examination period for that course. No written examinations, including final examinations, may be scheduled during the Prep Week. No quizzes may be given during Prep Week. No project/lab practicals/paper/presentation deadlines or oral/listening examinations may fall during the Prep Week unless it was scheduled in the syllabus AND the course has no final examination (or assignment that acts as a final examination) scheduled during finals week. (A course with a lab component may schedule the lab practical of the course during Prep Week if the lab portion does not also require a Final Examination during finals week.) Class participation and attendance grades are permitted during Prep Week. The Senate Rules permit continuing into Prep Week regularly assigned graded homework that was announced in the class syllabus.\nFor fall and spring semester, the Thursday and Friday of Prep Week are study days (i.e. “Reading Days”). There cannot be any required “interactions” on a Reading Day. “Interactions” include participation in an in-class or online discussion, attendance at a guest lecture, or uploading an assignment. See Senate Rules 9.1 for a more complete description of required interactions.\n\n\n\nAccommodations Due to Disability\n\nAccommodations Due to Disability: In accordance with federal law, if you have a documented disability that requires academic accommodations, please inform your instructor as soon as possible during scheduled office hours. In order to receive accommodations in a course, you must provide your instructor with a Letter of Accommodation from the Disability Resource Center (DRC). The DRC coordinates campus disability services available to students with disabilities. It is located on the corner of Rose Street and Huguelet Drive in the Multidisciplinary Science Building, Suite 407. You can reach them via phone at (859) 257-2754, via email (drc@uky.edu) or visit their website (uky.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter). DRC accommodations are not retroactive and should therefore be established with the DRC as early in the semester as is feasible.\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Statement and Title IX Information\n\nNon-discrimination and Title IX policy: In accordance with federal law, UK is committed to providing a safe learning, living, and working environment for all members of the University community. The University maintains a comprehensive program which protects all members from discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. For complete information about UK’s prohibition on discrimination and harassment on aspects such as race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, and sexual orientation, please see the electronic version of UK’s Administrative Regulation 6:1 (“Policy on Discrimination and Harassment”) (https://www.uky.edu/regs/ar6-1). In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the University prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex in academics, employment, and all of its programs and activities. Sexual misconduct is a form of sexual harassment in which one act is severe enough to create a hostile environment based on sex and is prohibited between members of the University community and shall not be tolerated. For more details, please see the electronic version of Administrative Regulations 6:2 (“Policy and Procedures for Addressing and Resolving Allegations of Sexual Harassment Under Title IX and Other Forms of Sexual Misconduct”) (https://www.uky.edu/regs/sites/www.uky.edu.regs/files/files/ar/ar_6.2-in...). Complaints regarding violations of University policies on discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct are handled by the Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity (Institutional Equity), which is located in 13 Main Building and can be reached by phone at (859) 257-8927. You can also visit Institutional Equity’s website (https://www.uky.edu/eeo).\nFaculty members are obligated to forward any report made by a student related to discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct to the Office of Institutional Equity. Students can confidentially report alleged incidences through the Violence Intervention and Prevention Center (https://www.uky.edu/vipcenter), Counseling Center (https://www.uky.edu/counselingcenter), or University Health Service (https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/university-health-service/student-health).\nReports of discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct may be made via the Institutional Equity’s website (https://www.uky.edu/eeo); at that site, click on “Make a Report” on the left-hand side of the page.\n\n\n\nRegular and Substantive Interaction\n\nRegular and Substantive Interaction: All credit-bearing courses must support regular and substantive interaction (RSI) between the students and the instructor, regardless of the course’s delivery mode (e.g., in-person, hybrid, or online). Courses satisfy this requirement when course participants meet regularly as prescribed in SR 10.6, and the Instructor of Record substantively interacts with students in at least two of the following ways: provides direct instruction; assesses students’ learning; provides information or responds to students’ questions; and facilitates student discussions. Some exceptions allowed as per SACSCOC. For further information about the RSI requirement, see the Compliance Resources link on the Teaching, Learning and Academic Innovation Compliance page.",

    "text": "Files in Folders\nThe first thing to be clear about is that all files you’ve saved on your computer are in a folder (a.k.a. a directory). “Documents” or “My Documents” is a folder. Even your Desktop is a folder. This is true for both macOS and Windows. For example, I have an account on my laptop called “Display” for when I want to show how my computer works without showing everyone all of my personal files. In the Display account, I saved a little text file called Sampletext.txt to the desktop. In this screenshot, you can see Sampletext.txt shown both on my desktop, and as a file in a folder.\n\n\n\nDesktop is a folder\n\n\nWhat’s nice about this image is that you can see where Sampletext.txt exists in the context of my whole hard drive. My “Desktop” is just a folder that my computer shows the content of on my main screen. The Desktop folder is inside of a folder called “Display”. There are other folders in there, including my main user account, joseffruehwald. All of these folders are grouped together in the “Users” folder, and the “Users” folder is one of the first folders immediately underneath my hard drive.\nThe important thing to keep in mind here is that all files, programs, photos, etc are stored somewhere in a folder, inside of another folder, probably inside of another folder. You might not always interact with the files this way, and they might not always look like they’re in a folder, but they are.\n\nViewing the folder hierarchy on a Mac\nTo be able to better view the full hierarchy of folders on a Mac, I would recommend the following:\n\nOpen Finder, and in the View menu, select “as Columns”\nUnder the View menu again, select “Show Path Bar”\n\n\n\nViewing the folder hierarchy in Windows\nAt the top of the file browser on Windows, you’ll see the sequence of files in which the current folder is embedded.\n\n\n\nWindows directory structure",

That’s because style.css is no longer in the same folder as site.html. We’ll need to update the link to the stylesheet to reflect the fact that it’s now in a different folder, like so:\n\nhtml\n\n&lt;link \n  rel=\"stylesheet\" \n  type=\"text/css\" \n  href=\"assets/style.css\"&gt;\nHere’s how site.html interprets the string assets/style.css:\n\nLook inside the folder you’re currently in for a folder called assets\nThen, look inside of that folder for a file called style.css\n\nWe could take it a step further, and create a new folder called “css” inside of “assets”, and put our stylesheet there instead.\n\n\n\n`assets/css/style.css`\n\n\nFrom site.html to style.css: assets/css/style.css\nNow, we’d need to update the link to the stylesheet to look like this\n\nhtml\n\n&lt;link \n  rel=\"stylesheet\" \n  type=\"text/css\" \n  href=\"assets/css/style.css\"&gt;\nAgain, breaking this down into how site.html interprets the string assets/css/style.css goes like this:\n\nLook inside of the same folder as yourself for a folder called assets\nLook inside of that folder for a folder called css\nLook inside of that folder for a file called style.css",

You can see the absolute path for style.css at the bottom of the very last screen shot.\nDifferent operating systems have different short hands for describing the top level, or hard drive level, of the path. On macOS, it’s simply a / at the beginning of the path. On Windows, it usually begins with C:\\.

    "text": "Looping through the poem\nAbove, I ran .split() on the non-case folded poem. What if I wanted to lowercase each line of the poem now, after the fact. We can use a for loop to do this. Let’s build up to it.\n\nfor-loop skeleton\n\n\npython\n\nfor line in plums_lines:\n    myspace_line = \"xXx \" + line + \" xXx\"\n    print(myspace_line)\n\nxXx This Is Just To Say xXx\nxXx By William Carlos Williams xXx\nxXx  xXx\nxXx I have eaten xXx\nxXx the plums xXx\nxXx that were in xXx\nxXx the icebox xXx\nxXx  xXx\nxXx and which xXx\nxXx you were probably xXx\nxXx saving xXx\nxXx for breakfast xXx\nxXx  xXx\nxXx Forgive me xXx\nxXx they were delicious xXx\nxXx so sweet xXx\nxXx and so cold xXx\n\n\nLet’s unpack the first line of the for loop:\nfor line in plums_line:\nThis tells python to take each value in plums_line, assign it to a new variable called line, then do something. After it has done something, it goes and grabs the next value from plums_line, assigns it to a variable called line, and starts over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome common misconceptions\n\n\n\n\nWhat we tell python to name the variable it creates does not affect the way the for loop works. We called it line to make the code readable. If we really wanted to pull out every noun from the poem, and said for noun in plums_lines:, it is not going to pull out every noun.\n\n\n\npython\n\nfor noun in plums_lines[0:2]:\n    print(noun)\n\nThis Is Just To Say\nBy William Carlos Williams\n\n\n\nWhat we do inside of the loop doen’t have to involve the line variable at all.\n\n\n\npython\n\nfor line in plums_lines:\n    print(\"plum\")\n\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\nplum\n\n\n\nWhat the for-loop did does not get saved anywhere. The only “state” that gets preserved at all is the final one.\n\n\n\npython\n\nmyspace_line\n\n'xXx and so cold xXx'\n\n\n\n\nThis last point is super important. To save, or remember, what happened inside of a for-loop, you need to do two things.\n\nCreate a variable outside of the loop.\nUpdate the variable inside of the loop.\n\nFor example, if we wanted to get the total number of characters in the peom, we’d need to\n\nCreate a collector variable outside of the loop.\nAdd update its total value inside of the loop.\n\n\n\npython\n\ntotal_chars = 0\n\nprint(f\"The total number of chars is now {total_chars}\")\n\nfor line in plums_lines:\n    line_len = len(line)\n    total_chars = total_chars + line_len\n    print(f\"The total number of chars is now {total_chars}\")\n\nprint(f\"The final number of chars is {total_chars}\")\n\nThe total number of chars is now 0\nThe total number of chars is now 19\nThe total number of chars is now 45\nThe total number of chars is now 45\nThe total number of chars is now 57\nThe total number of chars is now 66\nThe total number of chars is now 78\nThe total number of chars is now 88\nThe total number of chars is now 88\nThe total number of chars is now 97\nThe total number of chars is now 114\nThe total number of chars is now 120\nThe total number of chars is now 133\nThe total number of chars is now 133\nThe total number of chars is now 143\nThe total number of chars is now 162\nThe total number of chars is now 170\nThe total number of chars is now 181\nThe final number of chars is 181\n\n\nThis use of a for-loop makes the “loop” part clearer.\n\n\n\n\n\nstateDiagram\n    state \"for line in lines:\" as for\n    state if_line &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;\n    state fork &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    state fork1 &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    [*] --&gt; fork1\n    fork1 --&gt; total_chars: set to 0\n    fork1 --&gt; for\n    for --&gt; if_line\n    if_line --&gt; fork: If another line\n    if_line --&gt; [*]: If no more lines\n    fork --&gt; total_chars: +len(line)\n    fork --&gt; for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo actually lowercase the poem now, we need to\n\nCreate an empty list outside of the loop.\nAdd the lowercased line to this list inside of the loop.\n\n\n\npython\n\nlower_lines = []\n\nfor line in plums_lines:\n    lower_lines.append(\n        line.lower()\n    )\n\nlower_lines\n\n['this is just to say',\n 'by william carlos williams',\n '',\n 'i have eaten',\n 'the plums',\n 'that were in',\n 'the icebox',\n '',\n 'and which',\n 'you were probably',\n 'saving',\n 'for breakfast',\n '',\n 'forgive me',\n 'they were delicious',\n 'so sweet',\n 'and so cold']\n\n\n\n\nFiltering the poem\nThere are a few lines of the poem that are blank and have a length of 0.\n\n\npython\n\nprint(lower_lines[2])\n\n\n\n\n\n\npython\n\nlen(lower_lines[2])\n\n0\n\n\nWe can create a new list without these lines by\n\nCreating an empty list outside of the loop.\nAdding lines to that list inside the loop, only if they have a length greater than 0.\n\nThis introduces an if control block.\n\n\npython\n\nfull_lines = []\n\nfor line in lower_lines:\n    if len(line) &gt; 0:\n        full_lines.append(line)\n    else:\n        print(\"dumped an empty line\")\n\ndumped an empty line\ndumped an empty line\ndumped an empty line\n\n\n\n\npython\n\nfull_lines\n\n['this is just to say',\n 'by william carlos williams',\n 'i have eaten',\n 'the plums',\n 'that were in',\n 'the icebox',\n 'and which',\n 'you were probably',\n 'saving',\n 'for breakfast',\n 'forgive me',\n 'they were delicious',\n 'so sweet',\n 'and so cold']\n\n\nThe if block:\n\nChecks to see if the logical statement is True or False.\nIf True, it executes the code inside.\n\nIn this case, I’ve also included an else block.
