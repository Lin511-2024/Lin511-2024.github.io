So, in our notes on [finite state automata](01_fsm.qmd) and [push-down automata](02_pda.qmd) that since natural language has bracket matching patterns, and maybe even crossing dependencies, that it's more complex than a "regular" language, and can't really be parsed with a finite state automaton.

ngram language modelling asks the question: But what if we tried really hard?
