## Setup

We'll need to get our systems setup to work properly with the tools we'll be using this semester.

### VSCode and The Command Line

#### Windows Users

If you ware using a windows computer, Iâ€™ll ask you to install Windows
Subsystem for Linux like so:

1.  Follow the tutorial here for enabling and installing WSL [https://lingmethodshub.github.io/content/windows/wsl/00_installing_wsl.html](https://lingmethodshub.github.io/content/windows/wsl/00_installing_wsl.html)
2.  Install VS Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3.  Work through the first section of this tutorial, stopping after you connect to WSL [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial#_prerequisites](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial#_prerequisites)

#### MacOS/Linux Users

1. Install VS Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Python

We'll be using a program called `pyenv` to manage the versions of python we use. To install `pyenv`, open the VSCode Command Palette (with `Shift+Ctrl+P`) which will open the command line interface. Then, copy this but of code, paste it into the terminal, and hit enter.

``` bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Once that has successfully finished:

-----

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
#### MacOS Users

Run

```bash
open ~/.zshrc
```

If that gives you an error, run

```bash
touch ~/.zshrc
open ~/.zshrc
```


:::

:::{.column width="10%"}

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
#### WSL users
Run

```bash
open ~/.bashrc
```

If that gives you an error, run

```bash
touch ~/.bashrc
open ~/.bashrc
```

:::

Paste the following into the window that opens, and save it.

```sh
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```
