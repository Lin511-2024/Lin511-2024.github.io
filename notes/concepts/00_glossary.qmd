  Copying can be done many ways, including selecting text with your mouse, right-clicking then selecting 'copy', by selecting text and using your computer's 'hotkey' for copying (Either `Ctrl-C` on Windows or `⌘-C` on Mac), or, in the course documents, by clicking on the 'copy' icon in most code chunks.

To paste, you can either right-click and select 'Paste', or use your system's 'hotkey' (`Ctrl-V` on Windows, or `⌘-V` on Mac).
